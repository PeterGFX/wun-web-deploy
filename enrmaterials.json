            "text": ["Extreme weather events such as heatwaves and tropical cycles has always been a threat towards our society, and under the persisting trend of global warming, it is evident that the societal impact of extreme weather will be enlarged through either the increase in occurrences, intensities and durations.",
                "Meanwhile, our world is still experiencing rapid urbanization and population growth, which resulted in the emergence of urban areas with high building and population densities that exposes large number of people to the potential risks of extreme weather events. These areas often lack consideration and planning towards mitigating the threat of extreme weather during their initial development and are therefore vulnerable towards the ever-increasing threat. In some cases, the lack of planning might even enhance the damages caused by extreme weather.",
                "The amplifying impact of extreme weather events in vulnerable urban areas has made investigating the mechanisms and pattern of extreme weather impacts more important than ever, where the results of these studies are essential for formulating mitigation strategies in future urban planning, so that the threat of extreme weather under climate change can be minimized."]
